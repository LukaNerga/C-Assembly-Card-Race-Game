C + Assembly Card Race Game

A simple grid-based game implemented in C with x86 Assembly integration.
Four card suits start at the bottom of a 5×4 grid and move upward based 
on randomly drawn cards. The first suit to reach the top row wins. Core 
logic, display, and game flow are written in C, while random number 
generation, movement, and win checking are implemented in Assembly, 
demonstrating low-level programming and C–ASM interoperability.


## Game Logic (Pseudocode)

Initialize positions of all suits at bottom row

WHILE game not finished
    Draw random card (suit, number)
    Move corresponding suit one row up
    IF any suit reaches top row
        Declare winner
        End game
END WHILE
